# Haskell Rule 110 Cellular Automata

This is code aims to provide a simple implementation of the Rule 110 Automata. It is also a personal excercise with the aim to learn Haskell, which means that the implementation will probably be not so good.

Rule 110 is a one of the 256 possible 1-dimensional cellular automata, made famous by Stephen Wolfram in his book `A New Kind of Science' and proven to be Turing Complete by Cook and Wolfram.
You can find more information about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) and [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule110.html);


## Usage

Compile the code by running
```
make
```
then you can execute the binary as
```
./rule110 size step
```
where size is how many columns(i.e. cells) there will be and steps is the number of times the function program will be applied.

## Output

The output of the program is a simple image using the NetBPM P1 format, a simple image viewer like feh, eog or sxiv can open it or you can convert it to a png using ImageMagick.
Each step is printed in the file, where the i-th step will be in the i+1th line, since the first one is the original state. The image will contain _size_ columns and _step+1_ lines.
